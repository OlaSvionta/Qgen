 "Generate Quote" button. When the button is clicked, the JavaScript function generateQuote() is called, which randomly selects a motivational quote from the quotes array and displays it on the web page.
To use this, create a new folder for your project and place the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files in that folder. Then, open the index.html file in your web browser. Every time you click the "Generate Quote" button, a new random motivational quote will be displayed.
Feel free to add more quotes to the quotes array to extend the collection of motivational quotes. Enjoy the inspiration!
